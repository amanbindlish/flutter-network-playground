## How to install and run

Before using this repository, I hope you have downloaded Flutter sdk and set it up on your machine. You can use Android studio or Visual code.
Post that fork this repo and on terminal run:
```shell script
flutter pub get
```
This will install all the required dependencies.
After successful installing dependencies, you can start an emulator and simply press play button to run it and there you go, you have your flutter built android/iOS app running. 

You can reach out to me for any updates and explanation and can also create pull requests for your updates here.
